> Abstract Wastewater reuse in the shale gas industry reduces firms' private costs and mitigates many of the local environmental harms associated with fracking. Most reuse occurs within the firm boundary, but rival operators often exchange (or “share”) wastewater prior to reuse. I use data from Pennsylvania to study how firms choose between internal reuse and transacting in the sharing market. To do so, I build a market-level model of wastewater management that endogenizes firms' make-vs-buy decisions. Estimating the model, I find that transaction costs associated with sharing are large — approximately $6 per barrel on average — but heterogeneous. Variation in the estimates reveals several channels for potential policy interventions to increase sharing rates. However, increased sharing may be undesirable: because firms' operations are clustered geographically, excessive internal reuse under the status quo generates a 13% reduction in transportation-related external costs from emissions and air pollution. Consequently, Pigouvian interventions that simultaneously address sharing market imperfections and environmental externalities can worsen environmental impacts.

[__Improving FTR Markets with Better Product Design: Contract Tenor, Market Thickness, and Efficiency__](papers/ftr.pdf)

> Financial transmission rights (FTRs) are an important class of contracts for managing congestion in decentralized energy markets. This paper explores how market operators' contract design choices affect the efficiency of FTR allocation. With shorter contract tenors, generators and electricity customers can obtain better hedging portfolios for anticipated congestion risk. However, speculator participation responds endogenously to contract design. Speculators can extract greater rents when FTR markets are thinner, leading to welfare losses for load firms. In order to understand the significance of this tradeoff I build and estimate a stylized empirical model of FTR allocation mechanism used by Midcontinent ISO (MISO), a large decentralized energy market. Relative to a counterfactual with longer contracts, MISO's current contract design reduces load firm welfare losses from congestion risk by \\$2.4M per year, or about 1% of total welfare at firms' estimated risk preferences, but reduces load firm welfare overall by \\$40-60M due to reduced auction proceeds, highlighting the value of careful contract design. However, the sign of the net welfare effect is sensitive to the estimated risk preference parameter, and reverses for reasonable alternatives.

> Financial transmission rights (FTR) markets are characterized by a complex strategic environment. Nevertheless, market prices are often a reliable predictor of future congestion prices. I explore whether the informational efficiency of FTR auctions is likely to carry over to an environment with more volatile congestion patterns (for example, due to greater renewable generation). In order to do so, I estimate an empirical model of Bayes-Cournot competition that microfounds information aggregation in FTR auctions. This approach enables me to account for essential features of FTR markets that are difficult to incorporate into standard empirical models of multiunit auctions, such as endogenous participation and cross-auction information spillovers.
