> Wastewater reuse in the shale gas industry reduces firms' private costs and mitigates many of the local environmental harms associated with fracking. Most reuse occurs within the firm boundary, but rival operators often exchange (or “share”) wastewater prior to reuse. This paper considers how shale gas producers in Pennsylvania choose between internal reuse and sharing, and whether additional sharing would be environmentally beneficial. To quantify the costs of sharing, I build a novel empirical model of firms' wastewater management decisions. Estimating the model, I find that transaction costs associated with sharing are large — increasing total water-related costs by roughly 10% — but heterogeneous. Variation in the estimates reveals several channels for potential policy interventions to facilitate further sharing. However, counterfactual exercises suggest that such interventions may have limited environmental benefits.

> Financial transmission rights (FTRs) are contracts issued by operators of deregulated energy markets for the purpose of creating firm transmission rights and allocating congestion revenues to market participants. This paper explores how the granularity of FTR contracts affects allocative efficiency, given the incentives of financial participants. With shorter contracts, it is feasible for generators and electricity customers (“load”) to obtain better hedging portfolios for anticipated congestion. However, if narrow contracts reduce financial participation, inframarginal financial participants can demand greater risk premia, leading to welfare losses for load firms (who are residual claimants on auction revenues). To quantify this tradeoff I build and estimate an empirical model of financial participation in the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) FTR auction. The model estimates imply that switching from three-month to annual contracts could potentially benefit load firms in MISO by inducing greater competition among financial participants.
