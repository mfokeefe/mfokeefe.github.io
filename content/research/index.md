> Wastewater reuse in the shale gas industry mitigates many of the local environmental harms associated with fracking, but market frictions such as transaction costs may inhibit socially efficient exchanges of reusable wastewater between rival operators. Exploiting regulatory data on firms' wastewater management decisions in Pennsylvania, I embed frictions at the firm boundary in an empirical model of insourcing and outsourcing. I find that only 55% of insourcing volume is attributable to within-firm cost efficiencies, with the remaining 45% attributable to market frictions. Since firms are geographically clustered, excessive insourcing reduces transportation-related external costs by 13% in equilibrium. A Pigouvian regulator who views frictions at the firm boundary as welfare-irrelevant distortions optimally provides heterogenous outsourcing subsidies in addition to an environmental tax, reducing social costs by up to $0.72 per barrel, but increasing external costs by 14% relative to a policy without subsidies. My findings highlight two distinct inference problems for a Pigouvian regulator: the problem of inferring transaction costs, and the problem of assessing their welfare-relevance.

[__Improving FTR Markets with Better Product Design: Contract Tenor, Market Thickness, and Efficiency__](papers/ftr.pdf)

> Financial transmission rights (FTRs) are an important class of contracts in decentralized energy markets. This paper explores how market operators' contract design choices affect the efficiency of FTR allocation. With shorter contract tenors, generators and electricity customers can obtain better hedging portfolios for anticipated deliveries. However, short contracts can directly or indirectly reduce market thickness in the FTR auction, leading to welfare losses. In order to understand the significance of this tradeoff I build and estimate a stylized empirical model of the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) FTR allocation mechanism. Relative to a counterfactual with longer contracts, MISO's current contract design reduces welfare losses from congestion risk by $2.4M, or about 1% of total welfare, at firms' estimated risk preferences. However, reduced auction proceeds result in aggregate welfare losses, highlighting the value of careful contract design.

__Information Aggregation in Auctions: Evidence from the MISO FTR Market__

> Financial transmission rights (FTR) markets are characterized by a complex strategic environment. Nevertheless, market prices are often a reliable predictor of future congestion prices. I explore whether the informational efficiency of FTR auctions is likely to carry over to an environment with more volatile congestion patterns (for example, due to greater renewable generation). In order to do so, I estimate an empirical model of Bayes-Cournot competition that microfounds information aggregation in FTR auctions. This approach enables me to account for essential features of FTR markets that are difficult to incorporate into standard empirical models of multiunit auctions, such as endogenous participation and cross-auction information spillovers.
