> Wastewater reuse in the shale gas industry reduces firms' private costs and mitigates many of the local environmental harms associated with fracking. Most reuse occurs within the firm boundary, but rival operators often exchange (or “share”) wastewater prior to reuse. I analyze how firms choose between internal reuse and sharing in Pennsylvania. To do so, I build a market-level model of wastewater management in which the extent of the sharing market is determined endogenously by firms' make-vs-buy decisions. Estimating the model, I find that transaction costs associated with sharing are large — approximately $6 per barrel on average — but heterogeneous. Variation in the estimates reveals several channels for potential policy interventions to improve sharing markets. However, increased sharing may be undesirable: because firms' operations are clustered geographically, internal reuse typically reduces transportation-related external costs. Pigouvian interventions that simultaneously address sharing market imperfections and environmental externalities can worsen local environmental harms.

[__Product Design in FTR Markets: Contract Tenor, Market Thickness, and Efficiency__](papers/ftr.pdf)

> Financial transmission rights (FTRs) are an important class of contracts for managing congestion in decentralized energy markets. This paper explores how market operators' contract design choices affect the efficiency of FTR allocation. With shorter contract tenors, generators and electricity customers (“load”) can obtain better hedging portfolios for anticipated congestion risk. However, speculator participation in FTR auctions responds endogenously to contract design. Speculators can extract greater rents when markets are thinner, leading to welfare losses for load firms (who are residual claimants on auction revenues). In order to understand the significance of this tradeoff I build and estimate a stylized empirical model of the FTR allocation mechanism used by Midcontinent ISO (MISO), a large decentralized energy market. Relative to a counterfactual with longer contracts, MISO's current contract design reduces load firm welfare losses from congestion risk by \\$2.4M per year, or about 1% of total welfare at firms' estimated risk preferences. However, overall load firm welfare falls by \\$40-60M due to reduced auction proceeds, highlighting the value of careful contract design.
