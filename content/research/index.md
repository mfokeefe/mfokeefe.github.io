> Market frictions such as transaction costs create a wedge between the real and shadow costs of polluting activities. I develop an equilibrium model of insourcing and outsourcing to quantify frictions at the firm boundary in the context of the market for fracking wastewater in Pennsylvania. In this setting, firms transport wastewater excessively long distances by truck to avoid market exchange, resulting in inefficient greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and elevated spill risk. Counterfactual simulations imply that, under a Pigouvian tax on trucking, marginal external costs are greater than marginal private costs under integration. Conversely, a Pigouvian subsidy to market participation induces sorting on non-targeted components of private cost, raising marginal external costs. In this context, market design interventions can be both a substitute for and complement to conventional environmental regulation.

__Improving FTR Markets with Better Product Design: Contract Tenor, Market Thickness, and Efficiency__ *Draft coming soon*

> Financial transmission rights (FTRs) are an important class of contracts in decentralized energy markets. This paper explores how market operators' contract design choices affect the efficiency of FTR allocation. With shorter contract tenors, generators and electricity customers can obtain better hedging portfolios for anticipated deliveries. However, short contracts can directly or indirectly reduce market thickness in the FTR auction, leading to welfare losses. In order to understand the significance of this tradeoff I build and estimate a stylized empirical model of the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) FTR allocation mechanism. Relative to a counterfactual with longer contracts, MISO's current contract design reduces welfare losses from congestion risk by $2.4M, or about 1% of total welfare, at firms' estimated risk preferences. However, reduced auction proceeds result in aggregate welfare losses, highlighting the value of careful contract design.
