[__Make, Buy, or Share: The Role of Interfirm Trade in Fracking Wastewater Reuse__](papers/wastewater.pdf)
<br>
December 2024.

<div style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-left: 25px; text-align: justify;">
Abstract Wastewater reuse in the shale gas industry reduces firms' private costs and mitigates many of the local environmental harms associated with fracking. Most reuse occurs within the firm boundary, but rival operators often exchange (or “share”) wastewater prior to reuse. I study the effect of wastewater sharing on reuse rates, transportation efficiency, and other outcomes. I find substantial private benefits from wastewater sharing, and modest external benefits. However, these benefits are diminished by the presence of large transaction costs. I explore the sources of these transaction costs and consider potential policy interventions to improve sharing markets and incentivize reuse.

[__Unilateral Market Power in Financial Transmission Rights Auctions__](papers/ftr3.pdf)
<br>
November 2024. Accepted at *The Energy Journal*

<div style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-left: 25px; text-align: justify;">
This paper explores market participants' incentives
to exercise unilateral market power in financial transmission rights
(FTR) auctions. I present a model of strategic bidding in FTR auctions
that illustrates how the standard market clearing mechanism for FTR
auctions facilitates cross-path competition, limiting
the profitability of demand reduction. Simulation evidence suggests
that this force can dramatically reduce rents from unilateral market
power relative to other sources of auction revenue shortfalls, highlighting potential adverse effects from proposed market reforms such as decentralized FTR sales and bidding-path restrictions
that may weaken cross-path competition.
