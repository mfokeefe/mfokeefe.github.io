> Shale gas production is highly decentralized, complicating efforts to address the local environmental impacts of fracking. Motivated by this, I analyze optimal environmental regulation when firm boundaries are relevant to external costs. I focus on the market for fracking wastewater in Pennsylvania. In this setting, firms transport wastewater long distances by truck to avoid market exchange, exacerbating greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and spill risk. Exploiting regulatory data on firms' insourcing and outsourcing decisions, I embed frictions at the firm boundary in an empirical model of wastewater management. I show that augmenting a simple uniform tax on trucking with outsourcing subsidies can reduce social costs by up to 49% of private trucking costs if frictions at the firm boundary are viewed as internalities. Otherwise, a uniform tax is socially optimal, and results in external costs that are 12% lower. My findings highlight two distinct inference problems for a Pigouvian regulator: the problem of inferring transaction costs, and the problem of assessing their welfare-relevance.

__Improving FTR Markets with Better Product Design: Contract Tenor, Market Thickness, and Efficiency__ *Draft coming soon*

> Financial transmission rights (FTRs) are an important class of contracts in decentralized energy markets. This paper explores how market operators' contract design choices affect the efficiency of FTR allocation. With shorter contract tenors, generators and electricity customers can obtain better hedging portfolios for anticipated deliveries. However, short contracts can directly or indirectly reduce market thickness in the FTR auction, leading to welfare losses. In order to understand the significance of this tradeoff I build and estimate a stylized empirical model of the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) FTR allocation mechanism. Relative to a counterfactual with longer contracts, MISO's current contract design reduces welfare losses from congestion risk by $2.4M, or about 1% of total welfare, at firms' estimated risk preferences. However, reduced auction proceeds result in aggregate welfare losses, highlighting the value of careful contract design.
