> Shale gas production is highly decentralized, complicating efforts to address the local environmental impacts of fracking. Motivated by this, I analyze optimal environmental regulation when firm boundaries are relevant to external costs. I focus on the market for fracking wastewater in Pennsylvania. In this setting, firms transport wastewater long distances by truck to avoid market exchange, exacerbating greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and spill risk. Exploiting regulatory data on firms' insourcing and outsourcing decisions, I embed frictions at the firm boundary in an empirical model of wastewater management. I show that augmenting a simple uniform tax on trucking with outsourcing subsidies can reduce social costs by up to 64% of private trucking costs if frictions at the firm boundary are viewed as internalities. Otherwise, a uniform tax is socially optimal, and results in external costs that are 14% lower. My findings highlight two distinct inference problems for a Pigouvian regulator: the problem of inferring transaction costs, and the problem of assessing their welfare-relevance.

> Financial transmission rights (FTRs) are an important class of contracts in decentralized energy markets. This paper explores how market operators' contract design choices affect the efficiency of FTR allocation. With shorter contract tenors, generators and electricity customers can obtain better hedging portfolios for anticipated deliveries. However, short contracts can directly or indirectly reduce market thickness in the FTR auction, leading to welfare losses. In order to understand the significance of this tradeoff I build and estimate a stylized empirical model of the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) FTR allocation mechanism. Relative to a counterfactual with longer contracts, MISO's current contract design reduces welfare losses from congestion risk by $2.4M, or about 1% of total welfare, at firms' estimated risk preferences. However, reduced auction proceeds result in aggregate welfare losses, highlighting the value of careful contract design.

> The rate at which market prices aggregate information is difficult to characterize analytically in many realistic environments, such as when ex ante asset endowments are heterogeneous, information is distributed asymmetrically, and the number of competing traders is not known in advance. In this paper, I estimate an empirical model of Bayes-Cournot competition to quantify the rate of information aggregation in financial transmission rights (FTR) auctions, which among other purposes are intended to elicit accurate information about future congestion prices in electricity markets. FTR auctions are particularly well suited to this purpose because key primitives such as ex post asset values, agents' types, and asset endowments are directly observable. Moreover, the structured and multi-round nature of FTR auctions results in significant cross-sectional heterogeneity. I discuss the implications of the model estimates for the design of FTR markets.
