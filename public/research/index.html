<blockquote>
<p>Financial transmission right (FTR) prices reveal valuable information about future congestion in electricity markets, facillitating efficient contracting and generation. I explore how electricity market operators&rsquo; contract design choices affect the informational efficiency of FTR auctions. Excessively narrow contracts can lead to thin markets and noisy prices, while overly broad contracts result in information loss. To quantify this tradeoff I build and estimate a stylized empirical model of the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) FTR allocation mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="make-buy-or-share-wastewater-disposal-in-the-marcellus-shale">Make, Buy, or Share: Wastewater Disposal in the Marcellus Shale</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In natural gas production, wastewater disposal is associated with heavy trucking activity and the risk of spills, drinking water contamination, and seismic activity. In Pennsylvania, firms frequently reuse wastewater to economize on transportation costs, mitigating these externalities. Using detailed geographical data, I decompose Pennsylvania natural gas producers&rsquo; wastewater disposal costs into transportation costs, markups, and transaction costs, demonstrating that transaction costs are significant. Policies targeted at reducing contracting frictions can mitigate externalities associated with trucking and final disposal of wastewater. However, such policies reduce the cost of drilling overall, potentially undermining broader policy objectives.</p>
