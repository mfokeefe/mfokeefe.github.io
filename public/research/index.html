<blockquote>
<p>In many areas of environmental policy, the size of externalities and effectiveness of policy interventions is mediated by the presence of transaction costs. I study how transaction costs affect firms&rsquo; ability to efficiently coordinate wastewater reuse in the Pennsylvania oil and gas industry. Using detailed geographical data, I decompose producers&rsquo; wastewater disposal costs into transportation costs, transaction costs, and markups. I find that transaction costs are substantial and lead to excessive wastewater trucking at the margin. Moreover, transaction costs encourage firms to integrate horizontally, potentially resulting in less efficient allocations. Finally, I compare policies aimed at reducing contracting frictions to Pigouvian taxes on trucking. This analysis may inform policy approaches in other shale basins as unconventional drilling becomes more widespread outside the United States.</p>
